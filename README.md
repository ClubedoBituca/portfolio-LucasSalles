# Personal Portfolio | Creative Developer & Cultural Producer

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository. This project showcases my journey bridging the gap between **Cultural Production** and **Technology**, featuring projects in Web Development, Machine Learning, and Project Management.

The application is built as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using React and Vite, optimized for performance, SEO, and Generative Engine Optimization (GEO).

## 🚀 Technologies

This project is built with a modern tech stack focused on performance and developer experience:

- **Core:** [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (Migrated from Next.js)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) & [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **3D/Graphics:** [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) / WebGL
- **SEO & Head Management:** [react-helmet-async](https://github.com/staylor/react-helmet-async)
- **Data Structure:** JSON-LD for GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)
