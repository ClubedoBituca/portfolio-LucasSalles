        <h1>What problems I solve</h1>
        
        <p>I design and build systems that turn complexity into something usable.</p>
        
        <p>Most of the problems I work on don't start with "we need an app" or "we need a dashboard". They start with confusion: fragmented data, manual processes, unclear metrics, or systems that technically work but don't support real decisions.</p>
        
        <p>I usually operate in environments where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data arrives incomplete, noisy, or continuously</li>
            <li>Decisions depend on trust in numbers, not just availability of data</li>
            <li>Operational work doesn't scale because too much depends on people</li>
            <li>Systems need to balance correctness, performance, and cost</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Instead of focusing on isolated features, I focus on end-to-end problem solving.</p>
        
        <h2>Types of problems I typically solve</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Turning raw data into decision-ready systems</h3>
        <p>I design pipelines and analytical models that connect data ingestion, transformation, and consumption. The goal is not just storing data, but making it reliable, explainable, and useful for decision-makers.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Structuring analytics that people actually trust</h3>
        <p>Many organizations have dashboards, but few have confidence in them. I work on data modeling, transformations, and metrics definition so analytics reflect reality and can be defended when questioned.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Automating workflows without losing control</h3>
        <p>I build automation systems where repetitive work is handled by software, but critical decisions remain observable and interruptible. This includes human-in-the-loop architectures and clear fallback paths.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Designing systems where backend correctness matters</h3>
        <p>In fullstack projects, I prioritize data consistency, validation, and separation of concerns. The frontend improves usability, but the system's reliability lives in the backend.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Reducing complexity instead of hiding it</h3>
        <p>Some problems can't be simplified away. In those cases, my job is to structure complexity so it's understandable, maintainable, and scalable over time.</p>
        
        <h2>How my projects relate to these problems</h2>
        
        <p>Each project in my portfolio is not an isolated experiment, but an application of these principles in a different context:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>data pipelines and analytics platforms,</li>
            <li>optimization and algorithmic decision support,</li>
            <li>AI-assisted automation,</li>
            <li>fullstack applications with non-trivial backend logic.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The domain changes, but the type of problems stays consistent.</p>
